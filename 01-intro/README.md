# Flexbox

Flexbox is a layout method for arranging items in rows or columns. You can easily stretch or shrink items with this technique.

We used to do layouts with floats, but they were quite limited. Vertical centering or responsively dividing space between child elements were really difficult to achieve.

In a few examples we will look at flexbox basics so we can easily build complex layouts.

The very best resource I have found is the '[a guide to flexbox](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/)' tutorial on CSS Tricks. We will probably reference that guide a few times during the exercises.
